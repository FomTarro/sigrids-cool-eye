<!--
note first time you authenticate, it will close and generate a file called token.json, open the file with a text editor and in streamid: "here" place your stream id example streamid: "SS_BbsF5CwE" after that run the program, note the modelids wont work for you you will need to use the getmd(websocket) function to get your currently loaded models id or use listvtsmodel(websocket) to get all at once tough it will be hard to tell the difrence(in the futer i might add a auto setup)
